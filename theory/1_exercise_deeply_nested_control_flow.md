## Exercise

### Remove the deeply-nested control flow in ```count_contained_points```!

## Exercise part 1
> Start by introducing guard clauses and removing duplications using:
>    - ```invert if```
>    - ```merge if```, and/or 
>    - ```remove redundant else```
>

## Run tests after each reasonably small refactoring step!
