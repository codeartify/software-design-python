## Exercise

### Create composed method in ```count_contained_points```!
 
## Exercise
> Improve readability by ```extracting methods``` for 
>    - validating coordinates (e.g. ```validate_coordinates(x_coords, y_coords)```) and 
>    - counting points within the circle (e.g. ```count_points_within_circle(x_coords, y_coords)```)
> 
>   
>   to remove duplications and make it easier to read. 
>   You can also think about extracting even smaller functions within 
>   these methods to make it mean something to a human being rather 
>   than a machine.

### Run tests after each reasonably small refactoring step!
