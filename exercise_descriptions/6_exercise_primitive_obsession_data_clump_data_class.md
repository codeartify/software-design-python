## Exercise

### Introduce a strong ```Point``` type for the ```Circle```'s center coordinates

## Exercise part 1

> Replace ```self.x``` and ```self.y``` with a stronger ```Point``` class in ```Circle``` for ```Circle```'
> s ```center``` coordinates.
>    * Use the ```Parallel Change``` refactoring to step-by-step replace ```self.x``` and ```self.y```
       with ```self.center``` (which is of type ```Point(x,y)```)
>    * Make sure you run the tests after each reasonably small step

## Exercise part 2

> If you finish early, introduce a stronger ```Radius``` class for the primitive ```self.r```.

Move the classes to new files point.py and radius.py.
