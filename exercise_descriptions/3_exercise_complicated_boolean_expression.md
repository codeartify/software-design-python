## Exercise 

### Make the contains method more readable!

## Exercise part 1
> In the method ```contains```, extract two variables for the delta 
> between x coordinates and y coordinates. 
>   * Use the automated refactoring “extract variable” if possible. 
>

## Exercise part 2
> Extract a new (static) method or function to _square_ values. 
>   * Use this method everywhere where variables are multiplied with themselves. 
>   * Use the automated refactoring “extract method”. 
>   * Don’t forget to rename square’s parameter to e.g. “value”.
